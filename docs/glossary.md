# Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for common terms and concepts in AI voice technologies.

## A

**API (Application Programming Interface)**
- A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.

**Audio Codec**
- A program or algorithm that compresses and decompresses digital audio data.

**Buffer**
- A temporary storage area for audio data during processing or transmission.

## C

**Cloning (Voice)**
- The process of creating a digital replica of a human voice using AI technology.

**Codec**
- Short for "coder-decoder," a program or algorithm that compresses and decompresses digital data.

## D

**Deep Learning**
- A subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to model and process complex patterns.

**Digital Signal Processing (DSP)**
- The manipulation of digital signals, including audio, using mathematical algorithms.

## E

**Endpoint**
- A specific URL where an API can be accessed to perform a particular operation.

**Error Rate**
- The percentage of errors in voice recognition or synthesis output.

## F

**Frequency**
- The number of cycles per second in a sound wave, measured in Hertz (Hz).

**F0 (Fundamental Frequency)**
- The lowest frequency of a periodic waveform, determining the pitch of a voice.

## G

**Generative AI**
- AI systems that can generate new content, such as text, images, or voice.

**GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)**
- A specialized processor used for accelerating AI and machine learning tasks.

## H

**Hertz (Hz)**
- The unit of frequency, representing cycles per second.

**HTTP/HTTPS**
- Protocols used for transmitting data over the internet, with HTTPS providing secure communication.

## I

**Inference**
- The process of using a trained AI model to make predictions or generate output.

**Intonation**
- The rise and fall of pitch in speech that conveys meaning or emotion.

## J

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**
- A lightweight data format commonly used for API communication.

## L

**Latency**
- The time delay between input and output in a system.

**LLM (Large Language Model)**
- An AI model trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text.

## M

**Machine Learning**
- A subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience.

**Model**
- A mathematical representation of a system or process, trained on data to make predictions.

## N

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- A field of AI focused on the interaction between computers and human language.

**Neural Network**
- A computing system inspired by the human brain, used in deep learning.

## O

**OAuth**
- An open standard for access delegation, commonly used for API authentication.

**Open Source**
- Software whose source code is freely available for modification and distribution.

## P

**Pitch**
- The perceived frequency of a sound, determining how high or low it sounds.

**Prosody**
- The patterns of stress and intonation in speech.

## Q

**Quality Metrics**
- Measurements used to evaluate the performance of voice systems.

**Quantization**
- The process of converting continuous analog signals into discrete digital values.

## R

**Rate Limiting**
- The practice of limiting the number of requests a user can make to an API within a given time period.

**Real-time Processing**
- Processing data as it is received, with minimal delay.

## S

**Sample Rate**
- The number of samples of audio carried per second, measured in Hz.

**Speech-to-Text (STT)**
- The conversion of spoken language into written text.

## T

**Text-to-Speech (TTS)**
- The conversion of written text into spoken language.

**Token**
- A piece of data used for authentication or authorization in API requests.

## U

**Uptime**
- The amount of time a system is operational and available for use.

**User Interface (UI)**
- The means by which users interact with a system or application.

## V

**Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**
- The process of detecting when a person is speaking in an audio stream.

**Voiceprint**
- A unique set of characteristics that identify a person's voice.

## W

## Y

**Yield**
- The percentage of successful voice processing operations.

## Z

**Zero-shot Learning**
- The ability of an AI model to perform tasks it hasn't been explicitly trained on.
