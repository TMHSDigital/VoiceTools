## Integration and Code Samples

This section provides guidance on integrating AI voice services into applications, including authentication methods, required SDKs, and environment setup.

### General Integration Approaches

While specific code samples aren't provided in the search results, we can outline general approaches to integration based on standard practices:

#### REST API Calls

Most AI voice providers offer REST APIs that can be accessed with standard HTTP requests. A typical integration would include:

```javascript
// JavaScript example (Node.js with fetch)
async function generateSpeech(text) {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.provider.com/tts', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      text: text,
      voice_id: 'selected_voice_id',
      output_format: 'mp3'
    })
  });
  
  if (response.ok) {
    const audioBlob = await response.blob();
    // Process audio blob
    return audioBlob;
  } else {
    throw new Error('Failed to generate speech');
  }
}
```

#### Authentication Methods

Most providers use one of these authentication approaches:
- API Key in header (most common)
- OAuth 2.0 (for more secure enterprise integrations)
- JWT tokens (for session-based authentication)

#### Common Integration Challenges

- **Rate Limiting**: Most services impose limits on requests per minute or day
- **Audio Format Compatibility**: Ensure your application supports the provider's output formats
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for network issues or API errors

### Provider-Specific Integration Notes

For detailed integration instructions, users should refer to each provider's official documentation, as integration methods can vary significantly between providers.

## Evaluation Criteria and Benchmarks

This section outlines metrics and methodologies for evaluating and comparing AI voice services.

### Key Evaluation Metrics

1. **Voice Naturalness**
